# Final_Project

As a team we decided to look at natural disasters and how that can impact living location decisions. Maybe you are looking for a place that has no earthquakes or wildfires but you would be okay with tornados. You would be able to use a heatmap to find out the optimal areas of the country for you. Each of us as a team chose a year to clean and edit the dataset to get it ready for machine learning. We got our information from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ and was able to take that dataset which had 44 columns and over 65,000 rows to around 18 columns and a little over 8,000 rows. With this data I was able to create some tables using Tableau to get a better idea what kind of information we are looking at. Getting this date ready for machine learning has had its complications because the dataset we are looking at isn't very easy to convert for regression testing. We are hoping with further analysis we will be able to pull the data we need from this information.
